Translation files are maintained automatically, but you can regenerate any of
them manually with "make <filename>"
All translation files are in the po/ directory, and named <LANG>.po
The po template is in the po/ directory, and named messages.pot

Regenerate messages.pot
  make po/messages.pot

Regenerate the Spanish .po file (same for any po/*.po files)
  make po/es.po

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The files listed in $(misc_files) are maintained automatically, but you can
regenerate any of them manually with "make <filename>".
Examples:

Regenerate README.md from README.md.src
  make README.md

Regenerate debian/copyright from debian/copyright.src
  make debian/copyright

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

debian/changelog is maintained automatically (that is, "dch" is called when
needed, you still have to manually edit once dch launches the editor), but you
can also update it manually any time.
This will run "dch" with appropriate commandline options to pre-load the pkg
name, version number, maintainer name, maintainer email etc.

  make changelog

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regenerate just the deb source pkg files (*.dsc, *.tar.gz)
This is usually done automatically.

  make deb-src
